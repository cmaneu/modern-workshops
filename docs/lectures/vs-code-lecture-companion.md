## Shortcuts for a better view

There is a ton of super useful shortcuts in Visual Studio Code. 

### Change Theme: `Ctrl` + `K`, `Ctrl` + `T`.

Dark themes are popular these days. However, depending on the screen you're 
projecting with, it may be less readable. In such a case, you should switch to
a light theme. The `Change Theme` command will allow you to switch themes
easily just before or in the middle of your presentation.

### Zoom In: `Ctrl` + `=` and Zoom Reset `Ctrl` + `0 (NumPad)`  

We tend to have pretty amazing screen resolutions on our devices, however, these
settings may not be appropriate while presenting. Zoom In your VS Code simply 
by using `Ctrl` + `=` command.

### Remove/Toggle Sidebar: `Ctrl` + `B`

Sidebar is useful when you're working on something, but it can be a distraction
while presenting. Hide it in a second with this shortcut.

## Zen Mode: `Ctrl` + `K` `Z`

Zen Mode allows you to remove all bars and pannels to show only your own code.
It's useful when you need some concentration, but also when you want to focus
your presentation on only one thing.

## Screencast mode: `Toggle Screencast Mode`

There is no shortcut for this one, but it's a neat feature. It will display 
any key combination as an overlay on top of Visual Studio Code. It's really
useful if you're showing to an attendance how to use Visual Studio Code.

## Hacker Type

Sometimes, the best way to explain a code concept is to live-code it. However, 
there is a lot of traps with this exercice.

[Hacker Type](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jevakallio.vscode-hacker-typer&wt.mc_id=modernws-github-chmaneu)
is a community VS Code extension that enables you to record yourself programming,
and then replay the same keystrokes by typing any keys. You can then safely
to 'live' coding and be assured your code will actually run.
